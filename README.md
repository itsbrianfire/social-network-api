# NoSQL: Social Network API
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This README will walk you through how to use it in Insomnia, how to install it, and how to make contributions.

This API will allow you to:
- `GET` all users
- `GET` user by id
- `POST` a new user
- `UPDATE` user by id
- `DELETE` user by id
- `POST` new friend to user
- `DELETE` new friend from user
- `GET` all thoughts
- `GET` thought by id
- `POST` new thought
- `UPDATE` thought by id
- `DELETE` thought by id

## Installation
This API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js for API functionality.

To install and run, open the code in VS Code. 

Run the terminal and `npm i` to install packages, `node utils/seed` to seed that database, and `npm start` to run the API in Insomnia.

#
## Usage
In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, this API uses [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) for JavaScript timestamps.

## Contributions
As the developer, I have coded this API using routes, models, seeds, controllers and the connection file to run the API in Insomnia. This API can be run after proper installation as seen in the instructions above.
